This was my dating site project, I was certain I could be the next Plenty of Fish! Turned out that spam was a much bigger problem than attracting users. I lost the most recent version of the site, this was the last backup I could find (it was 4 years ago!) and it is missing the Amazon S3 uploading portions.
